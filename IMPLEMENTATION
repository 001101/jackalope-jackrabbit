Jackalope implements the "client" part of Apache Jackrabbit in PHP. You need a
running Jackrabbit as storage backend. Apache Jackrabbit uses the Davex 
(extended WebDav) protocol to communicate between its client library and the 
actual storage backend. See http://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/RemoteAccess
Jackalope uses this protocol to talk to the backend. This allows us to 
completely separate the PHP and Java code - and the storage backend can run
on a different server if needed.


Architecture
************

In the src folder, you find mainly classes with the names as defined in the 
API. The two important classes not defined by the API are the ObjectManager and
TransportInterface. ObjectManager caches nodes and talks to Transport.
Transport is again capsulated with an interface. 
transport/DavexClient implements the HTTP communication with Jackrabbit.
To implement other storage backends, it would probably be enough to implement
a new Transport class.
