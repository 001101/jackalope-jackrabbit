Jackalope implements the "client" part of Apache Jackrabbit in PHP, according
to the PHPCR API interfaces.
You need a running Jackrabbit as storage backend. Apache Jackrabbit uses the
Davex (extended WebDav) protocol to communicate between its client library and
the actual storage backend. See http://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/RemoteAccess
Jackalope uses this protocol to talk to the backend. This allows us to
completely separate the PHP and Java code - and the storage backend can run
on a different server if needed.
