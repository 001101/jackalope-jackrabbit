# TODO for "perfect" support of JSOP vs. old-style

## Transactions

Transactions do not work yet, investigation with dev@jackrabbit.apache.org is under way. See [http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@jackrabbit.apache.org/msg27927.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@jackrabbit.apache.org/msg27927.html)

Removed the interface for now from Jackalope\Transport\Jackrabbit\Client so that tests are skipped and not fail
