We use jackalope-api-tests to run api level tests. If you intend to use
jackalope as a phpCR implementation, you should only look at the api-tests
here.
The tests folder in root contains unit tests to implementation specific
details. It is only of interest for debugging jackalope itselves.

Please see the README in root folder how to run the tests.
