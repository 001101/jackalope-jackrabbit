Setup
*****

This is only the frontend. In order to actually do something, you need the
Jackrabbit server. Please download Jackrabbit here: http://jackrabbit.apache.org
You need the jackrabbit-standalone-2.x.jar

Once you have the jar, start it with
$ java -jar jackrabbit*.jar

Now you are ready to use the library. Have a look at api-tests/bootstrap.php
too see how to instantiate a repository.


*****
Tests
*****

There are two kind of tests. The folder *api-tests* contains the
jackalope-api-tests suite to test against the specification.
This is what you want to look at when using jackalope as a phpCR implementation.
In order to run the tests, make sure you have jackrabbit running and added the
test workspace (see below).

The folder *tests* contains unit tests for the jackalope implementation.
You should only need those if you want to debug jackalope itselves or implement
new features. Again, make sure you have the test workspace in jackrabbit.

Setting up Jackrabbit
*********************
- Create tests workspace which is different from your default workspace.
See http://jackrabbit.apache.org/jackrabbit-configuration.html#JackrabbitConfiguration-Workspaceconfiguration
Or:
- Go to the directory you started jackrabbit-standalone (eg. /opt/svn/jackrabbit/jackrabbit-standalone/target)
- cd jackrabbit
- cd workspaces
- cp -r default tests
- cd tests
- change <Workspace name="default"> to <Workspace name="tests">
- start jackrabbit again
