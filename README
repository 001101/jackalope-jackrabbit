Setup
*****

This is only the frontend. In order to actually do something, you need the
Jackrabbit server. Please download Jackrabbit here: http://jackrabbit.apache.org
You need the jackrabbit-standalone-2.x.jar

Once you have the jar, start it with
$ java -jar jackrabbit*.jar

Download the test workspace on the Liip wiki : 
http://fosswiki.liip.ch/download/attachments/11501816/test_workspace.tar.bz2
Unpack and copy the tests directory into your jackrabbit/workspaces/ directory

Clone the jackalope project 

git clone git://github.com/jackalope/jackalope.git

Update submodules

git submodule init
git submodule update

Now you are ready to use the library. Have a look at api-tests/bootstrap.php
too see how to instantiate a repository.


*****
Tests
*****

There is our continuos integration server at:
http://bamboo.liip.ch/browse/JACK

Run phpunit from the api-tests directory. You should have a lot of failed tests,
but no exception. If you have something like this, it works (yeah, FAILURES are ok):
FAILURES!
Tests: 224, Assertions: 99, Failures: 8, Errors: 183, Incomplete: 6, Skipped: 10.

* Currently doesn't work with PHPUnit 3.5, use PHPUnit 3.4 (the latest stable release)


There are two kind of tests. The folder *api-tests* contains the
jackalope-api-tests suite to test against the specification.
This is what you want to look at when using jackalope as a phpCR implementation.
In order to run the tests, make sure you have jackrabbit running and added the
"tests" workspace (see below).

In order to run the tests, go to api-tests and run phpunit without any arguments.
It will read phpunit.xml and run all api test suites.

The folder *tests* contains unit tests for the jackalope implementation.
You should only need those if you want to debug jackalope itselves or implement
new features. Again, make sure you have the test workspace in jackrabbit.
